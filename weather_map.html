<!--Create a new HTML file called weather_map.html.-->
<!--As you complete each step, commit your changes and push them to GitHub.-->
<!--Using HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, and the OpenWeatherMap API, start by showing the current conditions for city you live in on your page.-->
<!--Update your layout and AJAX request(s) to display a five day forecast for the city you live in that looks like the screenshot below.-->
<!--If you want to add the icons the URLs for OpenWeatherMap's icons are formatted like: http://openweathermap.org/img/w/[icon].png where [icon] comes from the API response.-->
<!--Refer to your Mapbox API exercise. Recreate the map below your 5 day forecast. Read through the documentation for the Mapbox API and figure out how to allow the user to drop a pin on any place on the map. Once the user drops a pin, grab its coordinates and feed those into your OpenWeatherMap API. Update the five-day forecast with the information from those coordinates (you should also get rid of your input boxes at this point).-->
<!--Add a Mapbox text input to search by location and have the forecast update when a new location is searched.-->
<!--As a bonus make sure you can update the marker's position to the new search result.-->
